We feel that we may be optimistic with our estimates.
We want to follow a divide and conquer approach to developing this application:
We have 6 people, so we can split up into 3 groups to tackle the major features first.
For early functional models, these features can be thought of as disjunct from one another.
That is, we can build the activities inside Android Studios that don't depend on the other
activities for basic functionality.


Our tentative schedule is as follows:

Week 4-5
------
Note: These 3 tasks below will be done by subteams within our group. If each subgroup finishes each task in parallel, we will finish 
the MVP by week 5.
