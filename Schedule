We feel that we may be optimistic with our estimates.
We want to follow a divide and conquer approach to developing this application:
We have 6 people, so we can split up into 3 groups to tackle the major features first.
For early functional models, these features can be thought of as disjunct from one another.
That is, we can build the activities inside Android Studios that don't depend on the other
activities for basic functionality.


Our tentative schedule is as follows:

Week 4-5
Note: These 3 tasks below will be done by subteams within our group. If each subgroup finishes each task in parallel, we will finish the MVP by week 5.
A user will be able to set alarm to ring (make noise) at a specified time 
Priority 1: 1-2 Weeks 
App can be set so that the alarm is only turned off via scanning a QR Code
Priority 2 1-2 Weeks 
The user should be able to set their house location.
Priority 3 1-2 Weeks

Week 6
A user will be able to snooze an alarm

A user will only have a finite number of snoozes
Priority 3: 1 day
Have only one QR Code for the app that is capable of turning of the alarm.
Priority 4 1 Day
An alarm will vibrate the phone
